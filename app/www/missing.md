# Are all subjects included?

No, unfortunately they are not.  

Small changes in the counts of grades can lead to large fluctuations in proportions over time if the total entry size is small. For example, if there are 10 entries in a subject for two years running and 5 candidates achieve an A grade in the first year but 6 candidates do so in the second year, an increase of one A grade leads to an increase in the percentage of A grades of 10% (50% in year 1 and 60% in year 2). If the total entry were 100, then an increase of one A grade would only result in a 1% change in the percentage of A grades.  

For this reason, qualification-subject combinations with fewer than 100 entries in any year of the data are excluded from the dataset used. The table below contains all the excluded qualifications:
