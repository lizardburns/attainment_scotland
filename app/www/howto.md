# How should I use this app?

## "Plots and tables" tab
Make selections using the input menus on the left side of the screen to see a summary of the data in the plots and tables. You can select:

- the qualification type based on Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) levels ([read more about the framework at the dedicated SCQF website](https://scqf.org.uk/about-the-framework/))
- a subject or "All subjects" (overall attainment for all subjects for selected qualification type **combined**)

In the case of "Attainment over time", you can also select a grade threshold, for example "C & above", which will show the percentage of candidates that received a grade C or higher in the selected subject for the selected qualification type.  

## "Interrogate the data" tab
Make selections using the input menus on the left side of the screen to filter the complete dataset to identify subjects which follow patterns of change that interest you, e.g. View attainment across years for subjects where the percentage of A grades was higher in 2019 than in 2020.
