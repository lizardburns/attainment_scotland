# What do the graphs and tables show?

All of the graphs and tables visualise summaries of attainment in National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications.  

Two types of graph (and corresponding table containing the underlying data) are available in the "Plots and tables" tab:

1. **Attainment over time** - lines on the graph show how attainment at selected grade thresholds have varied between spring/summer exam sessions in different years. Grade thresholds are cumulative in the sense that "D & above" gives the percentage of entries that resulted in awarded grades from A to D.
2. **Attainment distribution** graphs are grade distributions where bar heights have been standardised among years to account for differences in the number of candidates entering for assessments from one year to another and allow attainment to be compared between years more fairly.

The two types of graph use the same data but show it in different ways. The "Attainment over time" graphs make it easy to see trends over time. The "Attainment distribution" graphs may make it easier to see shifts in overall attainment (e.g. fewer low grades, more top grades).
